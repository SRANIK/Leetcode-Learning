3174. Clear Digits

You are given a string s.

Your task is to remove all digits by doing this operation repeatedly:

Delete the first digit and the closest non-digit character to its left.
Return the resulting string after removing all digits.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"

Output: "abc"

Explanation:

There is no digit in the string.

Example 2:

Input: s = "cb34"

Output: ""

Explanation:

First, we apply the operation on s[2], and s becomes "c4".

Then we apply the operation on s[1], and s becomes "".

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.
The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all digits.

//Code
char* clearDigits(char* s) {
    char* s1 = s;
	char* s2 = s;
	do {
		if (*s1>='0' && *s1<='9') {
			s2--;
		} else {
			*s2++ = *s1;
		}
		s1++;
	} while (*s1);
	*s2 = '\0';
	return s;
}
