1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number (Easy)

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that
 j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].
Return the answer in an array.

Constraints:
•	2 <= nums.length <= 500
•	0 <= nums[i] <= 100

Example 1:
Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).
Example 2:
Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]
Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]

//Code
/**
 * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().
 */

int* smallerNumbersThanCurrent(int* nums, int numsSize, int* returnSize) {

    int i;
    int count;

    *returnSize=numsSize;

    int *c=(int*)malloc(numsSize*sizeof(int));


        for(i=0;i<numsSize;i++)
        {
            count=0;
            for(int j=0;j<numsSize;j++)
            {
                if(nums[i]>nums[j])
                {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            c[i]=count;

        }   
    return c;
}

Time Complexity
The code has a nested loop, where each element in the array nums is compared with every other element.

•	The outer loop runs numsSize times.
•	The inner loop also runs numsSize times for each iteration of the outer loop.
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the size of the array nums.
Space Complexity
The space complexity is determined by the extra space allocated during the execution of the code:
•	An integer array c of size numsSize is allocated.
•	Besides that, only a few integer variables are used (like count, i, and j).
Therefore, the space complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the array nums.
